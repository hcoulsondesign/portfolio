          <p>After 45 years of ownership, Andy and Jan Coulson passed ownership of the family buisness on to their daughter Meredith Coulson-Kanter and her husband Chris. Wanting to breathe new energy into the White Gull Inn and remain relevant to new younger generations, the Coulson-Kanters have begun redesigning their menus, borchures, and other marketing materials. In January 2020 they launched a new winter menu featuring a new wine selection and seasonal dinner items. <a href="#">View full project</a>.</p>

          <p>Daughter’s Recipes is the first cookbook released by Emilie Coulson-Salgado, founder and proprietor of Daughter’s Granola.
