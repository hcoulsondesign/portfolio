          <p>Originally from Wisconsin, I pursued my interests in science and technology studying Biochemistry and Computer Science at Colby College in Waterville, ME. During my time at Colby I fell in love with New Zealand while studying abroad and decided to return after graduating. Having grown up in a family of restaurateurs, I had learned to revere wine even before I could drink it, so upon moving to Marlborough, NZ, I pursued a career in their wine industry. Applying my BA in Biochemistry to this field, I earned a Graduate Diploma in Viticulture and Oenology from Lincoln University near Christchurch, NZ, in 2014. I have since worked primarily with Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Noir, Riesling, and Chardonnay from the Awatere Valley subregion of Marlborough.</p>
          <p>In 2018, I returned to the United States and relocated to Washington State where I dove into the American wine industry and Washington reds. I joined Upchurch Vineyard as Assistant Winemaker in August 2019 and currently hold down the fort at their Eastern Washington winery on Red Mountain.</p>
          <blockquote>"I have always loved that winemaking combines art, science, and sociability. The wines of Red Mountain showcase this confluence perfectly."</blockquote>

          <h3>A Passion for Design</h3>
          <p>The fortunate daughter of a creative mother, I grew up helping with interior decorating projects, holiday staging, and retail displays. In 2017, out of personal interest in another form of design, I completed a Certificate IV in Graphic Design through The Graphic Design School in Avalon, New South Wales, Australia. However, having awoken a passion for design and realizing its applicability to my work as a winemaker at a small family business, I am currently pursuing a Certificate in Front-End Development offered online through the University of Washington.</p>
