        <h3 id="auction">Community Involvement - Auction of Washington Wines</h3>
        <p>In August 2019, the Upchurch Vineyard team donated to and poured wine at the annual Auction of Washington Wines fundraiser benefiting Seattle Children's Hospital and WSU's Viticulture and Enology program. Washington Tasting Room Magazine wrote this about the event:</p>
        <article>
          <blockquote><h4>Auction of Washington Wines Breaks Record, Raises $4.5 Million</h4>
          <h5>A charitable wine event benefiting Seattle Children’s and Washington State University’s Viticulture and Enology Program</h5>
          <p>Woodinville, Wash. — Auction of Washington Wines (AWW) celebrated its 32nd annual weekend of charitable wine events August 15-17, 2019, raising over $4.5 million and hitting a new milestone for the second year in a row. The highest bid of the evening was $225,000 for a 1928 vintage Ford Roadster Hot Rod, receiving a $200,000 match from the Ellison Foundation, for a total of $425,000, the highest amount ever received for an auction lot in AWW’s history. Washington Tasting Room Magazine has been a proud media partner of this event for the past nine years.</p>
          <p>Over 200 winemakers, vintners and growers attended the events over the course of three days to celebrate, pour wines and offer wine-focused auction lots to help achieve this goal. Proceeds from the events benefit Seattle Children’s and WSU Viticulture & Enology Program.</p></blockquote>

          <p>Daughter’s Recipes is the first cookbook released by Emilie Coulson-Salgado, founder and proprietor of Daughter’s Granola.
